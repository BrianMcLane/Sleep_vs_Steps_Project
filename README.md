# Sleep_vs_Steps_Project

In this project we analyzed a data set to see if the number of steps you take during the day can effect the hours of sleep you get or your sleep quality. 
We found and downloaded a data set from Kaggle.com. After that we cleaned the data set in Jupyter Notebook. We then used SQL to query the data to find the specific data we watned to compare.
